# Godot [ REDACTED ] shader example

![](https://github.com/BalaDeSilver/Godot-REDACTED-shader-example/blob/Godot-4.0/assets/REDACTED.gif)

An example of a shader I made in Godot 4.0.

Since Godot 4.x no longer runs OpenGL, it no longer requires any overhead processing from GDScript.

Go [here](https://github.com/BalaDeSilver/Godot-REDACTED-shader-example/tree/Godot-3.x) for a 3.x version of this shader.
